I have built a few apps with Gemini using the shinylive technology to use the browser to compute. This page provides a landing for access to each individual project.  The interactions with Gemini and the resultant apps are on each page.  A few general themes.  (1) base R is far easier because of package version matching for the `shinylive` framework.  (2) bslib works well for maintaining consistent styles.  I stopped caring.
