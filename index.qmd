Building a Shinylive app with Gemini.

::: {.callout-tip}
## Prompt

can you help me build a shiny app for statistical distributions?  I want it to contain a drop down for sample sizes of 15, 30, 50, 100 and to include a drop down of distributions including the normal, binomial, geometric, poisson, uniform, and lognormal distributions.  Responsive to the choice of distribution, parameters should be fields to be entered by the user.  Once the user has made choices it should produce a table of summary statistics including the mean, standard deviation, and five number summary, and a histogram of the data.

Now I want to go back to the app and overlay a density plot and make the number of bins for the histogram a slider
